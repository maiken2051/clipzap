Clipboard Text Manipulator

## About ClipZap

I'm a software developer/architect and ClipZap is a utility I wrote to manipulate the contents of the Windows Clipboard. ClipZap takes the text contents of the clipboard, performs some kind of operation on the text, and puts it back on the clipboard.

It started out simply, a VB 6 application (yeah, really) that I used to add text at the beginning and end of each line. Eventually it acquired all sorts of additional functionality by accretion. For example, it URL-encodes and URL-decodes, HTML-encodes, and so on.

The source is kind of a mess since I initially ported it from VB 6 to VB.Net and then added new features over the years using a variety of naming conventions, etc. I'm only keeping it in GitHub because I use it everywhere I work and I'm constantly making small changes.
